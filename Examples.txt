# Usage Examples

## Basic Scan
Run a basic scan on the target host to check for open ports in the specified range.
```bash
python main.py example.com -p 1-100

# Advanced Scan with OS Detection
Run an advanced scan on the target host to check for open ports and detect the operating system based on TTL and TCP fingerprinting.

python main.py example.com -p 1-1000 --os-detect

# Stealth SYN Scan with SSL Analysis
Run a stealth SYN scan on the target host to check for open ports and analyze the SSL/TLS configuration.

python main.py example.com -p 1-443 -s SYN --ssl-analyze

# Custom Payload Injection
Inject a custom payload to a specific port on the target host.
from src.advanced.payload_injector import PayloadInjector

injector = PayloadInjector("example.com", 80)
payload = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: example.com\r\n\r\n"
response = injector.inject_payload(payload)
print(response)

# Service Detection
Detect services running on common ports on the target host.

from src.scanners.service_detector import ServiceDetector

detector = ServiceDetector("example.com")
common_ports = [80, 443, 22, 21, 25]
services = detector.detect_services(common_ports)
for port, service in services.items():
    print(f"Port {port}: {service}")

# Vulnerability Scanning
Scan the target host for common vulnerabilities.

from src.scanners.vulnerability_scanner import VulnerabilityScanner

scanner = VulnerabilityScanner("example.com")
vulnerabilities = scanner.scan()
for vulnerability in vulnerabilities:
    print(vulnerability)

# Stealth Scanning
Perform a stealth SYN scan on common ports on the target host.

from src.advanced.stealth_scanner import StealthScanner

scanner = StealthScanner("example.com")
common_ports = [80, 443, 22, 21, 25]
results = scanner.scan_ports(common_ports)
for port, status in results.items():
    print(f"Port {port}: {status}")
